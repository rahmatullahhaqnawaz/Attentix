## What is Attentix?

Attentix is a real-time student engagement tracking system for online education. It analyses student webcam feeds using computer vision, calculates a live engagement score from 6 facial signals, and automatically adapts the lecture experience — pausing videos, triggering quizzes, adjusting playback speed, and alerting the teacher when attention drops.

---

## Demo

### Student View — Upload Mode
Upload a recorded lecture session. Attentix analyses every frame and returns a full engagement report with second-level breakdown.

### Student View — Live Webcam
Real-time face analysis every 2 seconds. Score updates live, video speed adapts automatically, quiz triggers on inactivity.

### Teacher Dashboard
Upload up to 10 student recordings at once. Get class-wide analytics, AI suggestions, live alerts, and broadcast quiz controls.

---

## Features

- **6-signal face analysis** — eye contact, head pose, yawning, facial expression, motion, inactivity
- **Real-time engagement score** (0–100) updated every 4 seconds
- **Adaptive playback** — 1.5× speed when HIGH, 1.0× when MEDIUM, pause + quiz when LOW
- **Inactivity detection** — quiz triggered after 20 seconds of no movement
- **Batch video analysis** — teacher uploads up to 10 student recordings at once
- **AI feedback** — personalised suggestions for students and teachers
- **Live webcam mode** — streams frames to backend every 2 seconds
- **Teacher dashboard** — class-wide metrics, alerts, speed control, quiz broadcast

## Engagement Score Formula

```python
score = 0
if ear > 0.15:                    score += 40   # eyes open
if abs(yaw) < 45:                 score += 30   # face forward
if motion > 0.0003:               score += 20   # slight movement
if expression in ("focused", "neutral"):  score += 10

if abs(yaw) > 55:                 score -= 30   # looking away
if lip_ratio > 0.07:              score -= 15   # yawning
if expression == "drowsy":        score -= 10
if inactivity_sec > 30:           score -= 10

score = max(0, min(100, score))
```

| Score | State | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| > 70 | HIGH | Speed → 1.5× |
| 40–70 | MEDIUM | Speed → 1.0× |
| < 40 | LOW | Pause + quiz |

## Inactivity Definition

> *"Prolonged inactivity is defined as the absence of significant head or facial movement (motion < 0.0003 across all 468 MediaPipe landmarks) sustained for more than 30 seconds. When detected, the system pauses video playback and triggers a quiz to re-engage the student."*

---

## Evaluation Metrics

> *"The system was evaluated based on accuracy of event detection compared against ground-truth labels, robustness across varying lighting conditions and webcam qualities, and real-time usability measured by end-to-end latency from frame capture to score display."*

- **Accuracy** — precision/recall of yawn and inactivity detection vs manual labels
- **Robustness** — tested across bright, dim, and backlit conditions; 480p–1080p webcams
- **Latency** — < 500ms end-to-end from frame capture to score update

---

## Future Work

- Emotion detection using full expression classification
- AI-generated quiz questions from lecture transcript
- Multi-student real-time comparison dashboard
- Voice alerts for prolonged inactivity
- LMS integration (Moodle / Canvas)
- Mobile app with front-facing camera
